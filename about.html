			<h1>A little about myself...</h1>
			<p>
				So this section is going to be me blabbing about my journey throughout my time in the I.T. field. I’ll be touching on everything from what initially garnered my interest in 
				computers from the beginning, my decision to make it my field of study and career, the drivers behind the decision on remaining here and continued growth, as well as a few 
				stories along the way. 
				<br>
				I suppose the very start of my story is older than I am as it begins with a Commodore 64 that my grandfather acquired from his brother in law. After marrying and moving in with 
				my grandmother, this sits in the top of a closet for a few years due to having a piece needing to be replaced. One day in the early 90’s, my grandfather was at a place that used 
				to be held in Dallas called “First Saturday”. It was, for all intents and purposes, an open air computer market where you could buy, sell, or trade just about anything computers, 
				and the older the better. It turns out it was a great place where someone could buy a whole lot of hardware that would be considered obsolete at the time and offload it here for 
				wholesale prices; it was nothing short of amazing. 
				<br>
				You may have guessed where this went from here. My grandfather finds the piece to fire up the old Commodore 64, and before I knew it I was navigating directories on floppy disks 
				(the ones that were actually floppy) to start my favorite games.
