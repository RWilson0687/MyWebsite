			<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
			<p>I'm glad you could stop by! This is a website I have dedicated to my professional journey in the field of Information Technology. 
				For a mostly brief explanation of how I got here, feel free to head over to my <a href="about.html">About</a> section. If you would like to see my certifications, degree, or github link, 
				you can find that in my <a href="education.html">Education</a> section. If you would like to play some simple games to see an example of what you can use JavaScript for, 
				you can find that at the <a href="jsgames.html">JavaScript Arcade</a>. Lastly, stay tuned to see what is coming next, as my next project is to code some simple games in Python as well, 
				and those will be able to be found on the <a href="Pygames.html">Python Arcade</a>.</p>
