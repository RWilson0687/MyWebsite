/*
Constant Declaration:
    const cardArray = [...]:
        This line declares a constant variable named cardArray that will hold an array of card objects. 
        Using const indicates that this variable reference cannot be reassigned, though the contents of the array can be modified.
Array of Objects:
    The array consists of multiple objects, each representing a card. Each object contains two properties:
        name: A string that represents the name of the card (e.g., 'fries', 'cheeseburger').
        img: A string that specifies the path to the image associated with the card (e.g., 'images/fries.png').
Duplicate Cards:
    The cards are designed to have pairs (two cards of the same type). 
    For example, 'fries' appears twice, as do 'cheeseburger', 'hotdog', 'icecream', 'milkshake', and 'pizza'. 
    This duplication is essential for the mechanics of a memory game, where players must find matching pairs.
Summary
    The cardArray serves as the foundational data structure for the memory game. 
    It defines the types of cards available in the game, including their names and associated images. 
    By including duplicates, it ensures that there are pairs for players to match, which is a core element of the gameâ€™s functionality.

// Shuffle the cards
cardArray.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());

/*
Purpose:
    This line shuffles the cardArray so that the order of the cards is randomized each time the game starts. 
    This ensures that players have a different layout of cards in each game session, enhancing replayability.
Method:
    The sort() method is used with a comparison function that generates a random number. 
    The expression 0.5 - Math.random() produces a value between -0.5 and 0.5, which helps to randomly sort the elements in the array.

/*
Selecting DOM Elements:
    const gridDisplay = document.querySelector('#grid');:
        This line selects the HTML element with the ID grid, which will serve as the container for displaying the cards in the game.
    const resultDisplay = document.querySelector('#result');:
        This line selects the HTML element with the ID result, which will be used to display the current score or results (like the number of matches found).
Game State Variables:
    let cardsChosen = [];:
        This array will keep track of the names of the cards that the player has selected during the game.
    let cardsChosenIds = [];:
        This array will store the IDs of the selected cards (corresponding to their position in the cardArray). This is necessary for checking if two chosen cards match.
    const cardsWon = [];:
        This array will hold the cards that have been matched successfully. It keeps a count of how many pairs have been found.

Summary
    This section of the code handles two main tasks: 
            Shuffling the cards to ensure a random layout for each game
            Setting up essential variables for tracking the state of the game. 
        The chosen cards and their IDs are prepared to facilitate matching logic, while the DOM elements are selected for rendering the game interface
